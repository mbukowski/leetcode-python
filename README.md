Preparation and solution for Leet Code in python

## Notes
- look at the edge cases,
- check for specific data structure, 
- can be represented in better way data, 
- allocate memory or in place,
- start with naive solution may bring a good solution in long run

## Code Snippets 
init multidimensional table inline

arr = [ [0]*3 for i in range(3) ] -> lists initialised with 0
